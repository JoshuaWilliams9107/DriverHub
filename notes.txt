I have fully completed the CSS tutorial on W3Schools and will be designing
	and implementing a full website look in the upcoming weeks. I will be
	implementing a fully navigatable website and plan on making it look quite
	nice and easy to use.

I have found resources and done deep dive research into secure storage of data.
	This will be implemented in the upcoming sprints and any unsecure placeholder
	data that we use will be merely there for testing before we implement the 
	security measures.
