# Driver Hub
A website that allows truck drivers to earn points for good driving behavior.  The drivers can then use those points to buy products in an on-website customizable store.

## - About the Development of this Project -
This Semester-long Project was worked on by me (Joshua Williams), Jordan Wilson, and Anthony Frazier with me as the group leader for Professional Issues II.  We were given requirements and recieved requirements changes throughout the project.  To manage the development of this project we used Azure Devops to create user stories based on the requirements on the assignment.  We then followed Agile development methodologies by having 1 week sprints where we met at the beginning of the sprint and each selected some of those user stories that we deemed to be most important to finish at that time and added them to the current sprint.  We then had a sprint review session after the sprint was over, reflected on the previous sprint, and repeated the process.  There were 10 sprints in total and by the end of the 10th sprint we had a polished working product that we delivered and demonstrated to the client (the professor).

## - About the Project -
This project involved the creation of a web-app for the trucking industry.  Sponsors can create a sponsor account and then create a company to associate with that sponsor account.  The sponsor can then manage their catalog of items that is fetched using the Ebay API by blacklisting and selecting categories.  Sponsors also can add drivers to their company through either an invite code or by directly making new driver accounts to be associated with that company.  Sponsors also can reward drivers points based on good-driving behavior and drivers can use those points to purchase products in their sponsor's catalog.  Sponsors can also generate reports on purchases as well as manage their company.  There are also Admin accounts that can just generally manage everyone on the website using a web interface.  Furthermore, Sponsors and Drivers also have profiles where they can edit their account settings and information.
